# Estimation-of-endoscope-camera-motion-from-surgical-videos-with-deep-learning

The primary objective of this project is to develop an advanced AI model designed to estimate the motion path of an endoscope camera during surgical procedures. The approach involves analyzing the differences between adjacent frames to precisely determine how the camera has moved over time. The project uses artificial neural networks, and siamese neural network which take the image sequence as input and produce a homogeneous transformation matrix as output. By achieving this objective, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of surgical procedures.
